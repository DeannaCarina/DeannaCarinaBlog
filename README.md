## New Project Checklist
1. Install Django and the supporting libraries
2. Create a new blank django project and app
3. Set our project to use PostgreSQL and Clouinary
4. Deploy our new empty projct to Heroku

### Install Django and the supporting libraries
> pip3 install django gunicorn<br>
> pip3 install dj_database_url psycopg2<br>
> pip3 install dj3-cloudinary-storage<br>
> pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt<br>

### Create a new blank django project and app
> django-admin startproject {project_name} .<br>
> python3 manage.py startapp blog

Now we need to add the newly created 'blog' app to the list of installed apps in settings.py
1. Navigate to settings.py
2. At the end of the INSTALLED_APPS list, add "'blog',"
3. Make migrations:
> python3 manage.py migrate


### Set up project to use PostgreSQL and Clouinary

<strong>NOTE: If you get the error below during the steps to deployment:</strong>
django.db.utils.OperationalError: FATAL: role "somerandomletters" does not exist<br>
Run the following command in the terminal to fix it: "unset PGHOSTADDR"

<strong>PostgreSQL</strong>

1. Create a new app on Heroku
2. In the resources tab, search for Postgres in the add-ons box
3. Click on the settings tab and reveal config vars, copy the value of DATABASE_URL
4. At the same level as requirements.txt create a file called 'env.py'
5. Within the env.py, import os, and set up the DATABASE_URL and SECRET_KEY variables to match those in Heroku (generate a secret key from https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/)
6. In settings.py, import os, import dj_database_url, and set an if statement to retrieve the env.py file 
7. Remove the string in the SECRET_KEY variable and replace with os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')
8. Comment out the DATABASES section in settings.py
9. Make mirgrations: python3 manage.py migrate

<strong>Cloudinary</strong>

1. Log in/Sign up to cloudinary and navigate to the dashboard
2. Copy the API Environment Variable key to the clipbaord
3. Make a new environ in env.py and copy in the URL (removing "CLOUDINARY_URL =" from the beginning)
4. Paste the URL into the Heroku config vars as well
5. In the Heroku config vars add: DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC and set the value to '1'
6. In the INSTALLED_APPS section above the static files string, add "cloudinary_storage" and above blog, add "cloudinary"
7. Towards the bottom of settings.py in the static files section, add the following:
    <ol>
        <li>STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage'</li>
        <li>STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')]</li>
        <li>STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')</li>
        <li>MEDIA_URL = '/media/'</li>
        <li>DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'</li>
    </ol>
8. In the buildpaths section of settings.py add: TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')
9. In the templates section of settings.py for the DIRS key, add the following value: [TEMPLATES_DIR]
10. Add the heroku app into the ALLOWED_HOSTS section: {app_name}.herokuapp.com and add localhost so we can run it locally
11. Create the following directories/folders in the top level (same as requirements.txt): media, static, templates
12. Add a Procfile in the top level of the repository and add the following: web: gunicorn {project_name}.wsgi
13. Deploy via heroku dashboard or via CLI
